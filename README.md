# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

A brief Excel analysis of Kickstarter campaigns

## Overview of Project

Louise, a project creator, needs help understanding how to run a Kickstarter (a crowdfunding project) campaign for a play. To best do this, analytics were done to process data outcomes in a visual, easy-to-interpret way.


### Purpose

The purpose of this projects was to become more familiar with Excel analytics, as well as present information and data to Louise in a succinct, palpable way. Going forward, Louise will have better information on how to do a campaign for a theater play. 

## Analysis and Challenges

The data in this project were analyzed using Excel functions. This includes, filtering, sorting, formulas, and generating pivot tables and charts. The latter were used to compare and present parts of the data together in a way to draw conclusions and see possible correlations.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data in this part of the project were analyzed using Excel functions. This includes, filtering, sorting, formulas, and generating pivot tables and charts. The latter were used to compare and present parts of the data together in a way to draw conclusions and see possible correlations. Module 1 properly prepared me for this section, and I did not face too many errors or challenges. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

For this part of the challenge, I had to create a separate sheet with goal ranges and count how many successes, fails, and cancellations there were in that dollar amount. From there, I next created a line chart to show a comparison of the ranges and how they fared in their campaigns.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

During processing of the Outcomes Based on Goals portion, I ran into a few challenges. I had everything almost completed in the new sheet when I realized all my Countifs functions were done incorrectly because I used the pledged dollar amount (column E on the Kickstarter sheet) rather than the goal dollar amount (column D on the Kickstarter sheet). This mistake took me a while to fix, but once I did, my chart looked correct, and I was able to understand and interpret the results. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Firstly, theater campaigns fare much better in summery months, May-August; winter months are less successful for theater, December being the worst. Additionally, theater campaigns rarely, if ever get canceled.
 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

A campaign needs to have a significant goal to be more likely to be successful, but not outrageous. The “sweet spot” is a goal of $35,000 to $40,000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Though the data pool seems to be a decent amount, this is only for theater and plays. Also, this is only over a few years, more data could change the model. Overall, the set does not seem to have major limitations.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

With a decent dataset as this, there are a number of tables and graphs that could be created, especially for other Kickstarter creators interested in other categories, like film and television. For Louise specifically, we could generate a table to determine what is the best length of time to run a campaign if she chooses to do so again.
